# Code of Conduct
Feel free to do whatever you wish.<br>
We entrust everyone willing to participate
in an open-source project to behave like a decent human being. So just don't be
a dick and all is fine. By participating in our community, you are also legally
obliged to praise kek.

Should you have reason to believe that the behavior of any individual in our
community hinders the progress of the project, you can contact an admin or
moderator on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AG8RPZ8)
and we'll find the best possible solution.
